# Namasteüôè

Thank you for taking your valuable time to know more about myselfüíûÔ∏è. 

I am actively looking üëÄ  for **an analyst position** to capitalise my problem-solving skill to provide meaningful Business Insights. Meanwhile I am also upscaling my profiles on GitHub by completing projects and HackerRank by consistently solving new problems. 
 
üå± In May-2022, I decided to pivot my career into the world of Data. I left my job as a Quality Assurance Specialist and enrolled my-self into an IBM Professional Data Analytics Certification and a Junior Data Analyst program offered by NPower Canada. After 4 months of rigorous study and practice, I have successfully enhanced my profile with Advance Excel, Advance Statistics, SQL, Python, Cloud Computing and Data Visualization skills. 

Previously working as a **Quality Assurance Specialist** and a **Customer Support Representative**, I have built the following skillset,
* **Technical Tools:** Excel, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Lean methodology, SAP
* **Soft skills:** Innovation, Effective Communication, Customer Service, Accountability, Collaboration

Back in India, I had completed my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and then worked as a **Jr. Project Co-ordinator** at one of the leading Green start up named Greenera Engineering. Working in an entrepreneurial environment, I had the pleasure of leveraging multiple responsibilities including project documentation, scheduling, sales, and inventory control. 
Growing up in the Indian culture has helped me to be a Competitive on field and off field a Jovial persona.

Though I am going to make my first step into the IT industry, but do not miss that I am bringing 3+ years of combined experience providing satisfactory solutions in CEM, Manufacturing & Retail Industry. I am grateful for what I have achieved and am equally passionate about gaining more as this process is a full-fledged learning curve. I still am exploring, learning, and adding skills to my portfolio.

If you feel you need someone like me in the team, let's connect and discuss.
I love reading and cooking too. So, if not by profession, let's connect by mutual interest.
